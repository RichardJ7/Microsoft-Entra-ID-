# Microsoft-Entra-ID
This repository documents my hands-on labs and my learning journey with Microsoft Entra ID. It also tracks my structured preparation for the Microsoft SC-300 certification. The goal is to display IAM skills, my continous learning and my preparation for an identity-focused cloud security role. 
<h2>Introduction to Entra </h2> 
To begin these labs, an Azure subscription must be acquired first.
