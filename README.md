# Microsoft-Entra-ID
This repository documents my hands-on labs and my learning journey with Microsoft Entra ID. It also tracks my structured preparation for the Microsoft SC-300 certification. The goal is to display IAM skills, my continous learning and my preparation for an identity-focused cloud security role. 
<h2>Introduction to Entra </h2> 
To begin these labs, an Azure subscription must be acquired first. For the purpose of learning, I used the Azure portal and created an organization that will be utilized exclusively for the labs related to Entra ID. There are features such as Privileged Identity Management or PIM, which require an Entra ID P2 license. I have acquired that license as well to provide me with increased Entra ID capabilities as I continue to navigate the environment and explore the features.
