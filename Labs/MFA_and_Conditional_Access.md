# MFA and Conditional Access

## Summary

This lab focused on configuring Multifactor Authentication and utilizing Conditional Access policies to accomplish such. This was implemented to increase the security of user login and understanding how to mitigate potential risks associated with user profiles and their access to resources within organizations.  

### Implementation Steps

1. MFA can only be configured if either the Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license is acquired. I acquired the P2 license upon the creation of this tenant with the intention of utilizing features, such as the aforementioned MFA. I first began by confirming that the feature was available which required me to first log in to the Azure portal.
