# User Creation

## Summary

After the initial setup of Microsoft Entra ID and the operating organization for the ensuing labs, the first task is creating a user through Entra ID. 

## Implementation Steps

1. Signed-in to Azure utilizing the organization account that was created as the Global Administrator. 
2. Navigated to the menu on the left side of the screen and pressedd the drop down menu labeled 'Entra ID'. There should be multiple options once expanded. Then I clicked on the 'Users' section. 
3. Selected the 'New User' option and then selected 'Create New User'. 
4. Began inputting the required information starting with 'User principal name', 'Mail Nickname', which included a box titled 'Derived from user principal name' and unchecked that box. Then, input 'Display Name' and 'Password'. I opted to not auto-generate the password so I unchecked that box as well. 
5. Next, selected the option 'Review + Create'. The following screen prompted another 'Create' option which was also selected. The new user appeared in the organization. Occasionally, the user may not appear immediately. If so, I refreshed the page and checked again to confirm. 
6. Navigated to the 'Users' section under the Entra menu and then select 'All Users'. Selected the user that was added and accessed the user's profile. 
7. A new menu appeared underneath the user's profile with options similar to the Entra menu under the tenant. Selected the option 'Assigned Roles'.
8. After selecting 'Assigned Roles', selected the option titled 'Add Assignments'. From the dropdown menu, I assigned the role of Application Administrator. I adjusted the settings after to assign this user the role for the maximum duration and selected the box titled 'Permanently eligible.'
