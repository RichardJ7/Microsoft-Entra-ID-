# Group Creation

## Summary

This lab was intended to exemplify the ability to create groups within Microsoft Entra. There are two different groups that can be created within Entra, Security and Microsoft 365. In this lab, I documented the creation of both group types within Entra but also, utilized the group licensing feature and assigned licenses to the configured groups. I document how licenses can be applied to individual users or assigned directly to groups. 

## Implementation Steps 

### Part 1: Group Creation

1. I began by first creating a Microsoft 365 group. To create this group, I had to navigate to the Entra admin center. I then selected the option labeled 'New Group' and I began to complete the required fields to satisfy the completion of the group.

2. At the bottom of the 'New Group' field, there were two additional options. The first, option was titled 'Owners' and the second option was titled 'Members'. I proceeded to select the 'Owners' field and designated myself as the Owner since I am currently the Global Administrator of the organization. After, I designated myself as the owner, I added the previous user that I created to the group.

3. Because I started with the Microsoft 365 group, I then began to replicate the group creation process however this time the group was a security group.
