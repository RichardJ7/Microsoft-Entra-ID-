# Group Creation
## Summary

This lab is intended to exemplify the ability to create groups within Microsoft Entra. There are two different groups that can be created within Entra, Security and Microsoft 365. In this lab, I documented the creation of both group types within Entra but also, utilized the group licensing feature and assigned licenses to the configured groups. I document how licenses can be applied to individual users or assigned directly to groups. 

## Implementation Steps 

### Part 1: Group Creation

1. I began by first creating a Microsoft 365 group. To create this group, I had to navigate to the Entra admin center.
